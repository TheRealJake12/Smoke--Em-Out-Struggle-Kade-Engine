# Optimization

## Requirements
1. A brain lol this is easy


### Step 1. Characters

Go to Assets/Shared/Characters

Remove all of the character files you dont need (Mom, Pico, Spookeez, etc.)
The Code Shouldnt matter but Keep the BF and GF and your Character Files


### Step 2. Charts

Remove all Charts that are gonna be unused (Bopeebo, Senpai, etc.)
Keep one if you dont have the charts set for being used.


### Step 3. Export Files

The Files will still be there in the export folder so you gonna wanna delete bin. Then Recompile your game.

Done, the caching should take less time to load, less things to load. fun.
